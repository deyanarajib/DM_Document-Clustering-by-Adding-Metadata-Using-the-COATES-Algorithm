# Document Clustering by Adding Metadata using the COATES Algorithm
Improve k-means clustering by adding side information (metadata) using algorithm called Content and Auxiliary attribute Based Text Clustering (COATES) which is adaptation method from a journal: "Text Mining using Metadata for Generation Side Information" by Shraddha S. Bhanuse, Shailesh D. Kamble, and Sandeep M. Kakde. This project was in a collaboration with my colleague, Indri Nurandini that has been used in her thesis research: "Clustering Hadist Menggunakan Algoritma Coates" at: http://digilib.uinsgd.ac.id/13510/ and her journal: "Klastering Dokumen dengan Menambahkan Metadata Menggunakan Algoritma COATES" at: https://journal.uinsgd.ac.id/index.php/kubik/article/view/1859
